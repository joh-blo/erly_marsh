<p>This tool is concerned with Model-based Testing, which is an approach to
making testing more systematic.
The general idea in model-based testing is to start from a formal model, which
captures the intended behavior of the software system to be tested.
Ideally, this model should be created early in the development process,
possibly even before the system is implemented.
On the basis of this model, test cases can be generated in a systematic way.
Since the model is formal, the generation of test suites can be automated, and
it is possible to generate test suites (i.e., sets of
test cases) that exercise all functionality of the tested software.
With adequate tool support one can
automatically generate very large test suites, and automatically quantify
to which degree they exercise all of the tested software.</p>
