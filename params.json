Since the model is formal, the generation of test suites can be automated, and it is possible to generate test suites (i.e., sets of\r\ntest cases) that exercise all functionality of the tested software.\r\nWith adequate tool support one can\r\nautomatically generate very large test suites, and automatically quantify\r\nto which degree they exercise all of the tested software.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
